In most of the Open Access (OA) journals of TU Delft OPEN Publishing there is a lack of transparency in the publishing workflows. Not every steps of the worfkow are described and available. It is necessary for authors to share their data when publishing in our journals. At the same time it is important for authors, reviewres and editors to understand the benefits of FAIR Data in open publishing. We should also provide a toolkit to the journals users to help the implementation of FAIR Data in the publishing workflow. Finally data sharing should be visible on the landing page of the related article.
