# FAIR-Data-in-Publishing-workflow
## Implement data sharing in academic publishing workflow for Open Access Journals ##

*Keywords: open data, FAIR Data, data sharing, metadata, open publishing*

### Milestones ###
1. Identify publishing workflow stages
2. identify in the workflow check points for data sharing 
3. get feedback from journal editors
4. Add FAIR Data to the publishing workflow 
5. Revise publishing workflow
6. Create a guide for journals users 
7. make visuals to highlight benefits of FAIR Data for journals users in open publishing
8. apply the above for open books and open textbooks


In most of the Open Access (OA) journals of TU Delft OPEN Publishing there is a lack of transparency in the publishing workflows. Not every steps of the worfkow are described and available. It is necessary for authors to share their data when publishing in our journals. At the same time it is important for authors, reviewers and editors to understand the benefits of FAIR Data in open publishing. We should also provide a toolkit to the journals users to help the implementation of FAIR Data in the publishing workflow. Finally data sharing should be visible on the landing page of the related article. 


## Engaging the stakeholders ##
1. Start with a Proof Of Concep (POC) with one newly launched AO journal and with one established OA journal => POC sucessful the new workflow with open data checkingpoints might be better accepted by the comunity if it is coming from their peer (editors).
2. Consider open data badges https://www.acm.org/publications/artifacts and 
3. Check Open results of the data badges: Pilot results, Challenges, and Opportunities https://researchdata.springernature.com/posts/open-data-badges-pilot-results-challenges-and-opportunities
4. Focus and encourage Data Citation https://www.project-freya.eu/en/pid-graph/the-pid-graph rather than DAS which is a standard section in most publications
5. provide a template for DAS and datsets Reviewers and example of dataset ciations & DAS

## Data Availibity Statement (DAS) ##
1. DAS often incomplete or in contradiction with FAIR data statement 
2. _Data available upon request_ is NOT acceptable
3. DAS should include datasets DOI and meaning metadata

5. DAS template could be useful

## Datasteward role ##
1. as expert they could perfome the DAS check of every submission
2. in teh case of TU Delft OPEn Publishing => approach 4TU Research data  

## What needs to be done ##

For all OA journals, list the steps of the publishing workflows and make a generic workflow.
Choose how and when to introduce FAIR Data in the workflow

#### Milestone 1: Identify publishing workflow stages ####
submission - peer review - publication 

#### identify in the workflow check points for data sharing  ####
before submission; before peer-review;after peer-review; after publication
